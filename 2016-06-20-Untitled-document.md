Today in our lesson we went through our github blogs. Many people including me had problems with this. So instead we just started from the beginning with a new repository. I struggled a lot with this because my old blog was completely broken and not working. So I had to publish all of my blogs from the beginning. Even though I still have problems with my blog I can still just about publish all of my blogs onto the website.
