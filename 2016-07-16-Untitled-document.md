A couple of days ago a huge attack happened in Turkey, supposedly by ISIS. all the Turks from the area tried to stop this which worked but they are all still afraid of this attack only being the start of something big.

Aa a follow on from the article above this happened. British school children who were on a trip were at an airport where there was an attack by ISIS.

This article shows that many MPs are already upset with the new PM as there are certain difficulties with Scotland.
