This week we were talking more about internet safety and the media. We started off by playing a game with a grid and different hobbies/things that someone has. We had to go around the class asking as many people as possible that do this thing. We then moved onto looking more at social media such as facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. We were told that twitter is one of the most dangerous places to be as anyone can see anything. There is no such thing as being private on twitter. We then moved onto looking at snapchat. The point in snapchat is that the picture that you post is only viewable for a matter of seconds. The reason that is is because people take naked selfies and post them on snapchat because people can only view them for a certain amount of time. This is called `sexting`.
