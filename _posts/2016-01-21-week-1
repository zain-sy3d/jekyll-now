This week we looked at adverts and looked out to see if they are real or fantasy. We first looked at a video which was mcdonald's canada and there was a lady that bought a burger and it was all squashed. She didn't eat it but she took it to the studio where they film the ads to compare the burger she bought from the shop to the same burger but in the ad. There was a very important person called a food stylist who styled the food which took upto i think three hours. Whereas in the shop it takes a matter of seconds. In the end the ad burger was about three inches taller than the normal burger and in the ad burger you could see every single element. They even use a syringe to get the sauces to show nicely out the burger.
