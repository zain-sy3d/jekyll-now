    <td>Today all the activities that we did all had lots and lots of numbers which was quite difficult to keep on top of but as we did a few more we got the hang of it. </td>

    <td>Today was extra difficult because my partner was not in school as he was having his appendix taken out in hospital. That was not very convenient as I had to work alone. Luckily another boy was working in a three so he joined me which was a huge relief. </td>

    <td>I think I did very well this week as all the things that we did were very successful, and therefore I did not have to repeat the code. </td>
