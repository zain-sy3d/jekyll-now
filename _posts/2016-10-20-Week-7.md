    <td>Today i learnt that asking your friends before the teacher is very useful because your friends might know the answer of what you need to know. In today's case Brendan gave me a lot of help including helping me to have my tables looking nice.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Today i unfortunately did not do any of the Fuze Box at all as i was engaged with my blog for the whole lesson. As that was what i wanted to set as the priority for the lesson as we had to hand them in at the end of the day.</td>

    <td>Next time i will do more research for my css files on Github instead of nagging my friend to help me. I will use W3Schools next time to enhance my work.</td>
