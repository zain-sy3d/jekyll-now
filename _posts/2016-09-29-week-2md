Today we carried on with our fuze project. Today I had a USB stick to save our work unlike last week. However me and Will found it tricky to save things onto the USB. After taking ages in typing out one of the programs it all got lost after trying to save it to the USB. I felt quite stressed when we had to do the, again with not much time left.
