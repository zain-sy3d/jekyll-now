    <td>Today was the first lesson of the year and we were working on the fuze box in pairs. At first i hardly knew what was going on but after about ten minutes of doing the activity i was starting to feel more comfortable. One of my friends did give me lots of help for the first 15 minutes but for the rest i was doing it perfectly well with my partner.</td>
