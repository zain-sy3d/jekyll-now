What are Peripherals?

There are three types of peripherals. Input devices, output devices and storage devices. An input device is something like a mouse or a keyboard that lets you put things into the computer. An output device is something like a printer or monitor which allows you to view things on the computer. A storage device is something like a hard drive which stores things for very long periods of time. You should not mix memory devices up with storage devices as they are different. Memory devices are for short term.

What is a Virus?

A virus is a program that goes into devices like computers, phones, tablets and other electrical devices. They are small programs that have access to your device to either copy personal files or even slow your device down, sometimes even completely stop it from working.

What is a Trojan?

Trojans are bad programs that perform actions that have not been authorised by the user. These actions can include:

* Deleting data

* Blocking data

* Modifying data

* Copying data

* Disrupting the performance of computers or computer networks

What is a Worm?

A computer program that copies itself to other computers across the internet is called a worm. Worms are often used to infect large numbers of internet connected computers. There are ways, however, of protecting your computer from such an attack. You can protect them by downloading antivirus programs.

What is Spyware and what does it do?

Programs that secretly record what you do on your computer are called spyware. They can be used for some perfectly good purposes, but the majority of spyware are for bad reasons. Its aim is usually to capture passwords, banking credentials and credit card details - and send them over the internet to criminals.

How do viruses spread to different devices and different places?

Viruses can spread to different devices and places when things like USB sticks or thing that you plug in are connected to your device. For example when there is a virus on your computer and you put a USB stick into it the virus will go into the USB and will go into the next device then into other devices and it keeps going on. Another way that viruses spread is through internet connection. For example there might be a virus on your phone which is connected to the internet, the virus can then go onto the hub and then to another device connected to that same hub.
