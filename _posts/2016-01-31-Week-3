Social media advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

Whenever you need help and you ask one person that cannot come you can post something out and lots of people will get the message.

You can communicate with your friends

You can communicate with friends and family that you have not met in a very long time maybe because they have moved to another country or something along those lines.

You can show your friends how you are doing and cool things.

Disadvantaged:

Most people say that they receive good news going on in the world however most of the news that you see on social media is complete nonsense.

If you are not on private mode anyone can see what you post online.

People can send you naked pictures especially adults when they are having sex. This is called 'sexting',
